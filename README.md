# 3D Printing Projects

This is a set of a few simple 3D printing projects. Modeling is done with 
[OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/), slicing with 
[Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)
and printing is on a [Monoprice Mini V2](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=21711).
